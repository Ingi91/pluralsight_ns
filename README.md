# RPS Conference App code 


* **This version is the Angular2 verison of the app**

*IMPORTANT:* If you are using version 2.5.0 of the NativeScript CLI, then it currently has a bug that doesn't allow copying of all necessary files for this demo. 

To check your version run this:
```
tns --version
```

Until a patch is issued, it is recommended to use the @next version of the NativeScript CLI. You can install it as follows:

If you are on Windows, install the @next version like this:
```
npm install nativescript -g
```

If you are on a Mac, install the @next version like this:
```
sudo npm install nativescript -g

```

------------
This is a companion app to my Pluralsight course Building Cross Platform Native Mobile Applications with NativeScript.
This app is based on the [TelerikNEXT app](https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-TelerikNEXT/) sample with a few things added.

Fork/clone the repository and run npm install in the rps-conf directory. 
This app is based on the Telerik NEXT app sample with a few things added.

Use this application to find-out how to implement common mobile scenarios with NativeScript.

## Running the sample

1. Make sure you have the [NativeScript Command Line Interface](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript) installed as well as all the prerequisites for the NativeScript development.

2. Fork and/or clone the repo:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/alexziskind1/courses-rps-conference-app-ng.git
  cd courses-rps-conference-app-ng/rps-conf-ng
  ```
3. Install the dependencies
  ```
  tns install
  ```

4. Run the project:

    `tns run ios|android [--emulator]`

    The `--emulator` keyword instructs the CLI to load the iOS simulator or an android emulator depending on the platform you want.
